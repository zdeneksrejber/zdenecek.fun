# Call for brave individuals! 

First post, eh! Welcome to space and place of mediocre madness!.

Times are challenging and so is grammar, and as a social creature, you need other creatures around. Well, today is your lucky day, I am a creature too. Although still young, I have been through some stories and adventures already, yet I might have something to share, or not. IT DEPENDS. What I am curious about is you.

## Didn't loose interest yet?

Then, feel free to reach out to me, we will have a lovely date dinner while we discuss meaning of live and Avs on their way for cup.

If you wish to discuss other topics, go on an adventure, or have any other wish or need, please include points below when getting in touch.
-  Your full name
-  General nature of request
-  Detailed description
   - use your own words
   - be brief, yet descriptive
   - focus on topic, but have a big picture
   - do not write this part if hungry
   - assume I know nothing
-  Preferred way of communication (verbal/non-verbal)
-  Favorite animal and why you picked doggos
-  Why you chose me?

You might find this odd, but I am not mad. Truth to be told though, there wasn't any test done to support such a claim.

Oh, and Im a good chef, so lets cook.
